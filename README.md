Discord AI Music Bot Project
Project Overview
This project is a custom Discord bot developed to provide entertainment and interactive features for a private community server. The primary goal was to create a personalized space where friends could interact with AI and listen to music together, while I practiced real-world software development workflows.

Key Features
Music Integration: Allows users to play and manage music within voice channels.

AI Interaction: Integrated with OpenAI to facilitate automated chat responses and interactive commands.

Version Control & Backups: Includes a structured backup system to ensure stable development when testing new "just-for-fun" features requested by users.

Technical Implementation
Language: Python using the discord.py library.

Security: Implemented environment variable management using .env files to ensure Discord Tokens and API keys are never exposed in the source code.

Source Control: Managed via Git, utilizing .gitignore and GitHub's Secret Scanning to maintain professional security standards.

Development Motivation
While the bot was designed for casual use among friends, the development process focused on solving technical challenges such as API rate limiting, asynchronous programming in Python, and secure credential management.
